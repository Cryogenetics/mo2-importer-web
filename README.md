## mo2-importer

This is a simple tool to import mods into Mod Organizer 2.

I created this with the intention of providing a service to the community, as this allows quick and simple sharing of
mods ( from nexus), just by exporing the list as a csv

# TODO:

- [x] Make decent UI
- [x] Create a way for users to supply token to download adult mods and skip 5 second timer on download (ended up being
  forced for downloads to even work)
- [ ] Program qol logic
-
    - [ ] Automatically check file if there is only 1 cat (excluding oldFiles) and only 1 file
